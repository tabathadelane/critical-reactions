# Critical Reactions!
### The ultimate resource for Faerun's best known adventuring party, Critical Reactions!
A marketing site for my DnD Party.


The inspiration is somewhere close to what a Real Estate or Insurance agent may use to sell customers on their service. Get to know us, read about our previous trials, customer testimonials, and more! The internet is the next big magical phenomenon to come to Faerun!

### App v.1

![Critical Reactions site demo with Bootstrap and Vue.js](crit-vue/src/assets/preview-gif.gif)



This is built using Django and DjangoREST hooked up to Vue.js on the front end. The styling utilizes BootstrapVue and Sass. This is my first time using Bootstrap. I try not to use libraries too much in this "learning" stage of my career change, as I like to try and build things from scratch when possible to understand how they work. I've been interested in Sass, and once I saw how Bootstrap and Sass worked together, it blew my mind! Also, the built-in responsiveness is SOOO nice. 

So far the backend is simple and maybe doesn't make sense to exist. I love Django and DjangoREST, and also, I kind of thought it would be a cool idea to have a skeleton front-end that could be hooked up to any database of a crew. All of the party information is dynamically filled in the Vue templates from the RestAPI. I even have a database column for D&D class themes (colors), which you will see on the "Members" tab. I have the templates also plug into in-line stlyes in a for loop for each member of the party. All of the colors come from the official D&D Beyond hexcodes for each class. NEAT! Also, I would like to add a blog and a service inquiry form to the backend later. 

*All of the flavor text on the site has been compiled with the collaboration of fellow player, Marika (Aella Picazo, Ranger). Please be patient as we work on this hobby. This will directly affect the completion of the Testimonials component.*


## Future Features of the Project

  - Add a blog section for the party's bard to share lavish tales from the road. 
  
  - Gather testimonials from previously satisfied customers to boast our abilities.

  - Provide an inquiry form so that prospective citizens in need can sumbit help requests at their convenience that the party can check from anywhere

# How to Download and Run This App:

## The Backend

This project uses virtual environments with pipenv. With pipenv installed, create the virtual environment:

```console
~/critical-reactions
$ pipenv shell
```

'Sync' to install the project's dependencies:

```console
~/critical-reactions
$ pipenv sync
```

***

## The Frontend

This project uses yarn for frontend dependencies:

```console
~/critical-reactions
$ cd crit-vue/

~/critical-reactions/crit-vue
$ yarn install
```

***

## Serve it

Now you will need two seperate terminals to run each chunk of the project. Make sure you are in the correct folders. 

###  Backend Server

You must be in the pipenv environment, or the server will throw dependency errors.

Also, if you are not serving on localhost:8000, the AJAX urls will fail. 

```console
~/critical-reactions
$ python manage.py runserver localhost:8000
```

### Frontend Server

```console
~/critical-reactions/crit-vue
$ yarn serve
```
On success, the terminal will then tell you the url for your server. It is commonly http://localhost:8080/

```console
App running at:
  - Local:   http://localhost:8080/
  - Network: http://<your-IP>:8080/
```

The inspiration is somewhere close to what a Real Estate or Insurance agent may use to sell customers on their service. Get to know us, read about our previous trials, customer testimonials, and more! The internet is the next big magical phenomenon to come to Faerun!

The plan with this is to make a Django and Vue.js fullstack application. The backend will be simple, but I want to expand it later. For now, the focus will be on seeing what I can do with Sass and Vue Components to make a sharp front-end. I would like to add a blog and a service inquiry form to the backend later.
